00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.700
Regular physical activity can lower your

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.320
risk of heart and
circulatory disease by 35%.

3
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.600
When you are active, the heat produced by

4
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.180
your muscles increases your body
temperature, making you feel warmer.

5
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.860
Your heart starts to beat faster, pumping
more blood to the muscles you're using.

6
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.900
Your heart is also a muscle.

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
If you are active regularly,
it gets bigger and stronger.

8
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.020
Your muscles are working harder,
so they need more oxygen.

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.780
You start to breathe faster so your blood
can pick up more oxygen from your lungs.

10
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.500
Your lungs work harder
to make this happen.

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.260
Once your blood has picked up oxygen,

12
00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:02.500
it moves the muscles you are using,
giving them the extra oxygen they need.

13
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.770
If you are active regularly, more

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.740
capillaries grow in the
muscles you've been working.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.980
This is one reason why activity
starts to feel easier over time.

16
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.980
Getting active is great
for people with diabetes.

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.570
If you have type two diabetes, you have

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.100
too much glucose in your blood, probably
because you don't have enough insulin.

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
Physical activity helps you
use the insulin you do have.

20
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.290
It also helps your cells use glucose
even when there is no insulin.

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
Regular physical activity can improve
your memory and attention span.

22
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.820
Over time, the bit of the brain involved

23
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.280
in memory and learning
seems to get bigger.

24
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.680
Longterm physical activity leads to a

25
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.660
lower resting heart rate
and lower blood pressure.

26
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.930
This helps cuts your risk of
heart and circulatory disease.

27
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.780
And there are more reasons to smile.

28
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.020
When you're active, your brain
produces chemicals called endorphins.

29
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.290
These reduce feelings of pain
and make you feel more positive.

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.610
Getting active cuts down on stress
hormones, reducing anxiety.

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.380
Combine activity with a balanced diet and

32
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.340
help yourself reach and
maintain a healthy weight.

33
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.980
Aim for 150 minutes of moderate
intensity activity per week.

34
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.300
Try to be active every day.

35
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.760
Every ten minutes counts.
